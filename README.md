# AndroidMirroring
An app to mirror an android device and view it from an iPhone/mac/windows/linux  device. (With samples!!! :D)

# Usage
This repository contains the android mirroring app in an Android Studio project and mirroring clients/viewers for various platforms.
The mirroring code exists mainly in 2 classes called **_AndroidViewer_** and **_AndroidServer_** which are used in the mirroring clients and servers respectively. The demo projects demonstrate how to use these classes.

Still making tweaks here and there so stay tuned for more.
